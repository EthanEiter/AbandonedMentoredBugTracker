# AbandonedMentoredBugTracker
AbandonedMentoredBugTracker is a node.js command-line tool that is being developed to track Mentored bugs from [bugzilla.mozilla.org](bugzilla.mozilla.org) that have been assigned but abandoned/not updated for more than three weeks.  This is being developed in response to [this request](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1128878 "Bugzilla Request") by [Josh Matthews](http://www.joshmatthews.net/blog/ "his personal blog").

It is in early development as of right now, but expect many changes to come!
